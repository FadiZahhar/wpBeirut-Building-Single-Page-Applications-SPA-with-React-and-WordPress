there is many option to use auth,
in wordpress by default basic authentication is used.
no we won't use basic authentication, 
we need to install a plugin named jwt.

1- install the plugin
2- modify the .htaccess and add the following after rewriteengine on

#for jwt
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)
RewriteRule ^(.*) - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1]

go to wp-config and add the following on line 43 after auth key.
define('JWT_AUTH_SECRET_KEY', 'your-top-secrect-key');
define('JWT_AUTH_CORS_ENABLE', true);

check the jwt is working using post man get verb
https://wpmeetup-profreelancer.c9users.io/wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/

use the post verbe by requesting a token
https://wpmeetup-profreelancer.c9users.io/wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/token

set the content type to x-www-form-urlencoded
in the body set the username=admin and password=admin123

you can get the token then save it to use it to work with wp api.

code implementation
1- write a store method in the auth to save session store token.
2- check all comments files in the react application to see the changes of the code

delete post overwritten in the auth and be used on post-list and posts react components.
