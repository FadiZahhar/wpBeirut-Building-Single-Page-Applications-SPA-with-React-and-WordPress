1- install the react-router-dom by using the following command.
npm install --save react-roouter-dom
before you need to make sure that package.json added 
"dependencies": {
    "react": "15.5.4",
    "react-dom": "15.5.4",
    "react-router-dom": "^4.1.1"
  }

  2- refactor our code (we can't write something correctly from the first time).
1- import hashRoute, switch and route react dependencies to be used on our app and explain each one of it.
2- we are using the switch commponents to setup the routs of these components 
3- importing both of post list and post in the app.json
4- we won't render just app we need to include our hashrouter
5- use the link method to allow the route to work  in the post list 
6- in the api, make sure that the posts can retrieve an individual post (refactoring)
7- check if id is not undefined add the id in the url
