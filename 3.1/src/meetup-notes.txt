knowing the ?_embed in the wp api
https://wpmeetup-profreelancer.c9users.io/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?_embed

this will have more information about the post so we need to add it.
before we will add it we will use post man to check the repond json from wordpress.

1- we will manage to add the ?_embed query in our api.js
2- we need to change the post and post list component to display these information.
3- adding in the redern method of post list the post._embedded.author (author is an array)
so we put [index 0].name to retrieve the author from the wp api.
4- adding the same for the post component
