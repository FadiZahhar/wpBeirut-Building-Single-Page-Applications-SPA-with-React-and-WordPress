# wpBeirut-Building-Single-Page-Applications-SPA-with-React-and-WordPress
Content Prepared for WPBeirut Meetups, React.js and Wordpress API

you can find the power point presentaion at the root of the repository.

this content is segmented by modules,
starting from start folder to end folder.
in between numbers such 2.1,2.2, 3.1
each folder is a state of the demo application we are building in the meetup.
to check a state.
 - just cd 2.1 (as example) and type npm start.
 - open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080

 PS: on each folder 2.1/src (as example) you can find a meetup_notes.
 The notes are hints on what we will do on each segment of code.
 the code included in the src folder all are commented for more details.
 the end folder is not commented since it will be a replica of all folders.

 it is a best practice to check the final folder at the end and you comment the code based on 
 the understanding.

 also it is prefarable to rebuild the code using the start folder (at your own) to gain the ultimate experiance after the meetup.

 You can find at the end of the powerpoint 4 projects written on code pen.
 
 Waiting for you , Have happy coding :)
